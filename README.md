🛠️ Technical Setup and Development (For Contributors)

This project is built as a lean, single-page web application to ensure fast load times and universal accessibility.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Core structure.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, ensuring a clean, responsive, and mobile-first design.

Vanilla JavaScript: Handles all interactive logic and state management (tracking checkmarks).

Local Storage (Default): Used to persist the user's progress locally within their browser.

(Note: For production use with multiple users, connecting a proper database like Firestore would be recommended for centralized data storage.)
